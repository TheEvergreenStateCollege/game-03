# Git-Tac-Toe Game 03

By ndeanon25

## Is there always a winning strategy?
I believe there is not a winnning strategy. If both players know how to play, it will always end a draw. 

## Under what conditions?
If both players know how to play, the only way for a player to win is that the other player messes up.

## If not, give a counterexample.
Both players understand the game of Tic Tac Toe, so that would be a counter example

## If there is a winning strategy, how would you describe it in English?
There is no winning strategy, you would have to force your oppenent to make a mistake.  

## Is there a way to express this strategy in pseudo-code?
 You could do a recursive method that finds the best move after each move.
